Among Us Website

The theme I chose for my website is among us, a game which is popular amongst youngsters. I wanted my website to showcase what the game was about, how it became and its latest version,
AmongUs-Vr. Therefore, I chose to make 3 pages for the whole website. A homepage, a history page and lastly a page promoting the new Among Us VR. 
I also didn't want the website to be a super formal or serious page.

Design Process:

This website is mainly an infographic place for new comers who are interested in the game as all pages of the game
provide helpful links to where to download the game and its VR version and much more. Note that this is an infographic page
and not the formal page where you can report bugs of the game and etc. I wanted to make information about the game stand out and 
always had a vision of adding a trailer at the home page. 



Features:

Exisiting Features:
1st: Have a navigation bar where users can navigate across all tabs(homepage, history and AmongUs-VR)
2nd: Have a playble youtube video which is the trailer of the game, this video size also adjusts when minizing
3rd: Links avaiable which takes users to websites, download pages or socials
4th. A social tab below to allow users to follow AmongUs/InnerSloth related content and news

Features Left to Implement:

Make the navigation bar scroll down as well


Technologies Used:

https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome
used to create logo icons for socials

https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik?category=Sans+Serif
for google font

Testing:

Everything could be flexwrapped with a mobile view.


Had an extremely hard time learning how to make the youtube video size adjust when minimising the page 
for a mobile view, but eventually learned how to solve it. Learnt very important knowledge about 
having liquid images and flex wrap too.
